# Hollux

Hollux is a hotel website that can be used for online reservations. Built using the [TALL Stack](https://tallstack.dev/): [Tailwind CSS 3](https://tailwindcss.com/), [AlpineJS 3](https://alpinejs.dev/), [Livewire 2](https://laravel-livewire.com/), [Laravel 9](https://laravel.com/). I actually made the UI here myself using Tailwind CSS and AplineJS without using any templates at all.

## Roles

There are 3 roles in this application, namely admin, receptionist, and user or guest.

### Admin

Admin can manage room data, facilities, and manage galleries that will be displayed to users or guests.

### Receptionist

The receptionist can check the check-in or check-out data from the user or guest and confirm it.

### User

The user here is a guest for this Hollux hotel. Users can make online reservations and review facilities and rooms if desired.
